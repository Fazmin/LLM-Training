## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There has been a significant surge in the development and release of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). With so much happening, it's become quite a task to keep up with all the latest developments. So, I thought it would be a great idea to compile a list of these open-source LLMs, complete with their licensing details, source code, and associated research papers or blogs.
